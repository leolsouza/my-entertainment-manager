# 🎬 My Entertainment Manager

**My Entertainment Manager** is a personal portfolio project that allows users to manage their favorite **movies**, **TV shows**, and **books** — all in one place.  
It’s built with **Next.js (TypeScript)** and focuses heavily on **Server Components** and **server-side rendering** to ensure performance and scalability.

This project is currently under active development, using **Supabase** as a temporary backend solution.  
A **dedicated backend** will be built in the future to provide more control and advanced functionality.

## 🚧 Project Status

> **⚙️ Work in Progress**  
> The project is still in development and not yet finalized.
